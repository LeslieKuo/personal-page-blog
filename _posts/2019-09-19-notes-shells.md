This is a brief reading note about the _Bourne Shell Scripting_ from [Wikibooks.org](https://en.wikibooks.org).

### What's SH (Bourne Shell)

Right after the Unix was invented, Stephen Bourne set himself to the task and came up with what he called a shell: a small, on-the-fly compiler that could take one command at a time, translate it into the
sequence of bits understood by the machine and have that command carried out. We now call this type of program an interpreter, but at the time, the term "shell" was much more common (since it was a shell over the underlying system for the user).

Stephen’s shell was slim, fast, and though a bit unwieldy at times, its power is still the envy of many current operating system command-line interfaces today. Since it was designed by Stephen Bourne, this shell is called the Bourne Shell. The executable is simply called sh and use of this shell in scripting is still so ubiquitous, there isn’t a Unix-based system on this earth that doesn’t offer a shell whose executable can be reached under the name __sh__.

### Improvements in SH

Indeed, requirements of user are growing fast while the original Bourne Shell cannot meet the them anymore.
