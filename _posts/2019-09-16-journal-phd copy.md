Recently, I told [Yaw Anokwa](http://anokwa.com/) about my confusion whether to pursue a Ph.D. and asked him for a recommendation letter if needed. He recommended me a book for reference, __The Ph.D. Grind__ wrote by Phillip Guo. This book is a depict of his six-year Ph.D. experience in Stanford CS department. And this post is something I thought after reading it.
